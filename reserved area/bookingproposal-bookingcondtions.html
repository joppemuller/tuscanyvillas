			<h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">Booking conditions <span style="color: red;">(Accepted on  31-03-2016)</span></h4>
			<div class="bconditions">
			<h5>1.) BOOKING</h5>
			<p>A deposit of approximately 35% of the property rental must be paid on booking by wire transfer into our bank account or using Paypal. No contract with us will exist until we have received your down payment. Only than your booking is considered confirmed. <span>The </span><span>contract</span> <span>prices are bound</span><span>.</span> <span>Subsequent</span> <span>price</span> <span>increases are</span> <span>thus excluded.</span> <span>Subsequent</span> <span>price reductions</span> <span>after a confirmed </span><span>booking</span> <span>can</span> <span>not be considered. </span>Should you later cancel, cancellation charges will become payable in accordance with paragraph 3. We reserve the right to refuse a booking without giving a reason. It is understood that this contract satisfies transitory housing needs only and that the contract automatically expires at the end of the rental period as stated on the Booking Form. A non refundable booking fee of 30.- Euro is due with every booking.</p>
			<br><h5>2.) PAYMENT OF THE BALANCE</h5><p>The balance due reflected on the Booking Proposal / Invoice must be paid at least&nbsp;45 days before arrival if not otherwise specified. If the balance is not received by us by the due date, we shall be entitled to cancel the booking without prejudice to our claim for cancellation charges and to retain the deposit. For bookings made within 45 days of arrival date, you will be required to pay the full cost of your stay at the time of booking.</p><br><h5>3.) BEST PRICE GUARANTEE</h5><p>
					For&nbsp;all our&nbsp;villas labeled with the button BEST PRICE, the following applies: if you find this villa at a cheaper price elsewhere within 3 days after your reservation, we will refund you the difference! The Comparison Rate must coincide with our offer and respect persons, travel period, cancellation policy, currency, sales and payment mode. The TUSCANY VILLAS - Lowest Price Guarantee ensures you definitely the best price for your Tuscany villa.</p>
				<br><h5>4.) CANCELLATION BY GUEST</h5><p>If you cancel all or any part of your booking, TUSCAN VILLAS shall be entitled to the following percentage of the total rental cost shown in your Booking Proposal:<br />
				15 days after payment of initial deposit 35% of total booking cost. <br />
				90 days before arrival 60% of total booking cost. <br />
				30 days before arrival 90% of total booking cost. <br />
				7 days before arrival 100% of the total booking cost. <br />
				Cancellation must be received by us in writing. We suggest to do a travel insurance that will cover your deposit paid in case of illness or other circumstances.</p><br><h5>5.) ALTERATIONS AND CANCELLATIONS BY TUSCAN VILLAS</h5><p>Though it is very unlikely we will have to make any changes to confirmed arrangements, but if for any reason beyond our control, (for example earthquake, fire, flooding ) we are unable to provide you with the property you have booked, we reserve the right to transfer you to a similar or better property. In case you don&rsquo;t accept this property, we will refund the total amount paid to us in full. We will not be liable for any further obligations or claims by you.</p><br><h5>6.) NUMBER OF PERSONS</h5><p>Only those persons listed on the Booking Form may use the property. The number of people must not exceed the number of sleeping places indicated in the Property Listing. Infants in portable cribs can sometimes be accommodated over and above the number of persons permitted but this must be explicitly agreed to in advance before balance payment is due. Should the key holder find any violations to this clause, it is totally up to her/his discretion to ask you to vacate the house without compensation.</p><br><h5>7.) ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE TIMES</h5><p>ou must arrive between 4pm and 7pm and leave before 10am on the day of departure unless alternative arrangements have been made in advance. Please provide arrival details no later than 30 days before arrival.</p><br><h5>8.) UTILITIES AND OTHER EXTRAS</h5><p>
					All Extras are specified on the Property Listing and are either payable in advance to Tuscan Villas or due in local currency on arrival/departure or during your stay. Those Extras due in advance to Tuscan Villas will be itemized on your Voucher. Meters will be read on arrival and departure and the exact charges will be due on departure. If you leave without being checked out as arranged, you risk the forfeiture of your entire Security and/or Utility Deposit. The property owner will deduct the cost of any unpaid utilities and telephone charges from your Security Deposit if the correct amount is not left in cash on departure and charge a 35.-Euro handling fee. At most properties, some staff are included. Additional cleaning service and cook are usually available by separate payment. If you arrange in advance for additional services, you will be responsible for the charges, even if you cancel. Payment terms are the same as stated above for utilities. Please give us as much notice as possible for these services.<br />
					<br />
					<span>Current information:<br />
					<br />
					We inform our customers that from 1.1.2012, in some communities of Tuscany, a newly introduced tourist tax is estimated. This amounts to between 1,00 and 3,00 EUR per person / night, usually for a maximum of 5-6 nights. It will be the owner of the villa that is responsible for collecting the tax which has to be discharged to the community.</span></p>
				<br><h5>9.) SECURITY DEPOSITS</h5><p>Security Deposits are due on many of the properties. This amount is determined by the owner and is required in <b>local currency upon your arrival (in Italy that would be EUROs)</b>. The Security Deposit covers the cost of any damage or breakages during your stay to the property and its contents, inside and outside, excluding normal wear. Judgment as to the condition of the property is left to the sole discretion of the owner. This amount, less any applicable claims (see paragraph 7), will be returned to you upon departure. Should the damages exceed the Security Deposit amount, you agree to pay the additional charges on demand.</p><br><h5>10.) BOOKING FOR NEXT YEAR</h5><p>
					You can book our villas a year or two in advance. Specially with larger Villas this should be considered. The definite Villa prices for the following year will be published September - October depending on the owner. In general rental prices remain the same. If you book now for next summer and prices will change later on we always apply the regular list price for the year of your rental. If your rental price goes up more than 6% you can cancel your booking without any costs.</p>
				<br><h5>11.) CONTENTS OF THE RENTAL PROPERTY</h5><p>The rental property will contain bedroom linens, bathroom linens and kitchen linens for the number of persons indicated on the web site. The fees for linen and towels are included in the general house fees show on the booking proposal. In general these fees are 15.- to 20.- &euro; each person per week. Each rental property will provide cookware, utensils, dishes/glasses and silverware in quantities necessary for the number of persons in the property.</p><br><h5>12.) COMPLAINTS</h5><p>
					Descriptions in the Property Listing are made in good faith.&nbsp;Published pictures and equipment can&nbsp;vary slighlty.&nbsp;However, we decline responsibility for any modifications made by the owners without our knowledge. We also do not accept responsibility for the breakdown of the supply of utilities or other essential services though we will, through our local agents, use our best efforts to arrange for these problems to be solved. If you have any problems during your stay, please phone Thomas Behnke at the numbers listed on your Voucher immediately. Complaints lodged at the end of the rental period will not be taken into consideration. Should you abandon the property without authorization from owner, key holder or property representative you will lose all rights to compensation.</p>
				<br><h5>13.) CLEANING</h5><p>The property will be clean throughout upon occupancy and must be left clean throughout by you at the end of the rental period. A final cleaning fee is add to each rental property, the cost varies according to the number of persons, the rental property and the presence of animals. Additional cleaning charges may be assessed against the Security Deposit if the home is not left in reasonable condition in the opinion of the owner or property manager. Cleaning requires that all trash is deposited outside the villa in the indicated containers, the plates and kitchen ware is left clean and that the refrigerator is left empty.</p><br><h5>14.) BEHAVIOR</h5><p>The person signing the Booking Form is responsible for the correct and decent behavior of his/her party. Should the person and his/her party behave in such a manner that is not acceptable by civilized standards, the key holder may ask the person and his/her party to vacate the house without compensation.</p><br><h5>15.)
